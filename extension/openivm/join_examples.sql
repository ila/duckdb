-- Normally, the GROUP BY would be by ID, and then the projection is by username, but DuckDB does not like this.
-- Perhaps because of the lack of primary/foreign keys in this example.
-- TODO: Support primary key so that GROUP BY g.user_name does not have to be used, but g.user_id as g's PK instead.
